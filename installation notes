I used rufus to install linux 16.04 from usb iso
After instalation Instalation i followed these instructions to install the relevant nvidia driver:
http://yangcha.github.io/GTX-1080/ 

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nvidia-367
sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev

Install CUDA 8.0RC. Download runfile(local). 
When install CUDA 8, make sure that when asked if you would like to install the old drivers - you refuse

I ran the following two lines and added them to the end of the .bashrc file 
(which is located in the home directory - if you can't see it press ctrl+H when inside the folder)

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}

once gpu+cuda+path were taken care of we can now check the installation is correct by:
nvidia-smi
