# clean_ubuntu_installation
set of commands for installing gtx1080 on ubuntu16.04 along with other machine learning libraries

this was initially written with reconstruction of my system in mind.

if someone else find it usefull i'd be more than happy.

use installation notes to get ubuntu 16.04 to run: 
* nvidia most recent driver (367.xx)
* cuda 8 rc + cudnn 5.1
* python + theano + keras + main data science packages
* xgboost 0.6a2
* opencv 3.1.0

use install R to install R and Rstudio
use install packages.R to install main data science packages for R
